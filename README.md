This is just my development code for my vardorvis bot.

I used Noxious halberd idk if that makes a difference during the kill.

only works with sharks and karambwan, you can change this in your code.

for your inventory you will need: supercombats, prayer potions, shark, karambwan, home tab, spec weap (only coded to use void waker), ring of shadows. (it will grab this from your bank).

only works automatically if you have ring of shadows with Vardorvis teleport tablet, ornate regen pool in your POH and the jewlery box thing maxed out.



-- I'm not going to update this code unless I come back to it for some reason.
-- You can just start this code while in Vardorvis Instance and it'l work.
